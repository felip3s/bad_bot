INT. BANK - DAY

The camera pans across a bustling bank, patrons typing away on their computers, children crying in the background, and the sound of cash registers chiming in the distance. Suddenly, the doors burst open and a group of five robbers, dressed in black tactical gear, storm in. Each of them is equipped with a black ski mask, a pair of Oakley goggles, and a pair of combat boots that look like they've seen some serious action.

Leading the group is the mastermind, JACK (30s), a tall, lean figure with a menacing scowl etched on his face. He's sporting a black tactical vest, complete with numerous pockets and pouches, each containing a different gadget or tool. On his right hip, he's got a custom-made holster for a Glock 19, the pistol itself gleaming with a chrome finish.

Next to Jack is his trusted sidekick, VICTOR (20s), a petite, wiry guy with a messy mop of hair and a black leather jacket with various patches and pins. Victor's holding a sleek, black laptop, a Wi-Fi antenna sticking out from the top, and a pair of earbuds plugged into his ears.

The other three robbers, MARCO (30s), LUCY (20s), and TY (20s), are all armed to the teeth. Marco's got a scoped rifle slung over his shoulder, a Remington 700 in .308 caliber, with a silencer attached to the barrel. Lucy's holding a compact, black pistol, a Beretta 92FS, with a pink grip wrap. And Ty's got a massive, black shotgun, a Remington 870, with a 12-gauge shell loaded into the chamber.

As they move through the bank, they're all wearing matching black backpacks, each containing a different device. Jack's got a custom-made explosive charge, a "shoe bomb" made from a modified Nike Air Max, with a detonator trigger attached to his wrist. Victor's got a portable, black router, a Linksys WRT1900AC, which he's using to hack into the bank's security system. Marco's got a pair of binoculars, a Bushnell 10x42, with a built-in laser rangefinder. Lucy's got a mini, black camera, a GoPro Hero8, which she's using to record the entire heist. And Ty's got a smoke grenade, a military-grade CS canister, which he's prepared to use as a diversion.      

The robbers move swiftly, taking control of the bank's security cameras and alarms. Jack steps up to the bank manager's desk and demands that they hand over the keys to the vault.

JACK:
(voice firm and menacing)
We want the keys to the vault, now. If you don't comply, we'll have no choice but to detonate the explosive charge.

The bank manager, a nervous-looking man in his 50s, hands over the keys. Jack takes them, and with a flourish, opens the vault. Inside, they find stacks of cash, gold bars, and various other valuables.

JACK:
(smiling)
Looks like we're in the money.

VICTOR:
(whispering into his earbuds)
I've got the security system down. We're clear.

LUCY:
(whispering to Marco)
You ready to take out the cameras?

MARCO:
(nodding)
I've got the rifle scope on the security monitors. I'll take them out one by one.

As the robbers continue to loot the vault, Ty slips out a smoke grenade and tosses it into the air. The bank erupts in a cloud of white smoke, and the robbers make their escape, leaving behind a trail of destruction and chaos.
